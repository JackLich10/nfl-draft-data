Smith.  Alex attempted only five passes as a freshman reserve QB in 2002.  He took over the starting job three games into his sophomore season vs. Cal in 2003 and wound up completing 65-percent of his passes for 2,247 yards with 15 touchdowns compared to just three interceptions.   He also rushed for 452 yards in 2003.  As a junior in 2004, Smith started all 12 games, went undefeated as a starter and led the Utes to a Fiesta Bowl win over Pittsburgh.  Prior to declaring himself available for the 2005 NFL draft, Smith completed 66.1-percent of his passes for 2,624 yards with 28 TD's and four INT's, while also rushing for another 563 yards and 10 TD's.  Smith could have used another year at the collegiate level in order to bulk up and improve his overall strength, but his decision makes sense following a nearly perfect junior season and with head coach Urban Meyer leaving for Florida.  Smith still needs to get bigger and he lacks ideal arm strength.  He also will have a big adjustment transitioning from the mid-major college level (Mountain West Conference) to the NFL.  However, there isn't a more intelligent quarterback in this class and few are as competitive.  Smith is a fine athlete, he has the frame to get bigger and he has enough arm strength to get by at the next level if he does everything else correctly.  In our opinion, Smith ranks just below Cal's Aaron Rodgers as the second quarterback in the 2005 class.  He likely would have been the fourth quarterback selected (behind Eli Manning, Philip Rivers and Ben Roethlisberger) a year ago, but in what is a noticeably weak top of the board in this year's draft Smith could very likely be a top-10 selection.","There isn't a lot that separates Aaron Rodgers from Alex Smith. Rodgers has the better arm, but Smith has the bigger frame. What it ultimately came down to was that new 49ers coach Mike Nolan fell in love with Smith's intelligence, charisma and overall intangibles -- and who can blame him?<br>

He completed 61.6 percent of his passes (215-of-349) for 2,903 yards, 19 touchdowns and only five interceptions in 13 games played in 2003, while also setting a school record for passing yards and completions in the 2003 Insight Bowl.  Earlier in his career, Rodgers has had some problems with ball security and made too many mistakes in when in the red zone.  There also was a minor durability issue after he had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee during the offseason prior to the 2004 CFB season.  However, Rodgers bounced back from the surgery with no ill-effects, had another tremendously productive season as a senior (67.5-percent, 2,320 yards with 23 TD's and seven INT's) and significantly cut down on his turnovers and red zone miscues.  Rodgers doesn't have great size and he could stand to get stronger, but he did measure in at 6-2, 223 pounds at the combine, which is at least adequate.  There has to be a minor concern regarding the wide-open quarterback friendly system that Rodgers played in at Cal, as it makes reads easier on quarterbacks and it also balloons their numbers with a lot of short passes that are turned into long gains.  Jeff Tedford is, however, an excellent quarterback groomer and he has done a terrific job with Rodgers' mechanics.  With two full years of starting experience under Tedford, Rodgers should be better prepared for the NFL than most other quarterbacks in this class.  Many of Rodgers' attempts in college were underneath, but there is no denying his arm strength and there is certainly no denying his accuracy and game-management skills.   In our opinion, Rodgers is the most complete quarterback in the 2005 draft class and he should be the first overall quarterback taken – likely somewhere in the top-five.  ","Rodgers was talked about as a potential No. 1 overall selection, but some bad luck and some concerns about his throwing motion and ability to adjust to NFL offenses sent him sliding. Nevertheless, there are worse places to land than as Brett Favre's understudy.<br>

He became the first freshman to start the season opener at quarterback for Auburn since Stan White in 1990.  Campbell started eight games in 2001, six games in 2002 and all 13 games in 2003.  He had by far his best season as a senior in 2004 when he completed 69.6-percent of his passes for 2,700 yards and threw 19 touchdowns and just six interceptions, while leading the Tigers to a perfect 13-0 record. Campbell has always had excellent size, good athletic ability and above average arm strength, but his poor decision making skills, lack of poise in the pocket, indecisiveness and erratic arm haunted him early in his collegiate career.  Throughout his first three seasons as a starter, Campbell consistently held onto the ball too long, threw too many passes up for grabs when he ran out of time, missed open receivers downfield and overthrew too many of the receivers that he did find open.  However, No player improved his draft value more in 2004 than Campbell.  After struggling through three extremely inconsistent and unfulfilling seasons, Campbell thrived as a senior in what was his fourth offensive scheme in four years.  New offensive coordinator Al Borges found the right fit for Campbell, as his West Coast scheme simplified things and gave Campbell a lot more definitive reads to make.  As his confidence improved, so too did his production.  Most impressive was Campbell's improvement in regards to his decision-making skills, as he threw 13 more touchdowns (19) than interceptions (6) in 2004.  Campbell has the physical tools of a first round pick but there are still questions about his downfield accuracy and ability to see the entire field.  That's why we grade Campbell out as a solid second round prospect. ","When the Redskins traded into the first round earlier in the week, many observers dismissed the notion they were targeting Campbell. But having landed CB Carlos Rogers at No. 9, Washington could afford to pick a QB who might take a couple of years to fully develop.<br>

Lee Owens, who recruited Frye and was the head coach at Akron for Frye's first three seasons, was fired at the end of the 2003 season, which was the main reason why Frye is contemplating the move.  However, he made a wise decision to return to school for his senior season for a few good reasons – most importantly that he needed the extra experience that he got as a senior.   Frye's supporting cast was not nearly as strong in 2004 as it was previously, but he showed a lot of toughness, durability and leadership skills.  He also has impressed with his mental capacity after quickly digesting the new offensive scheme.  In terms of overall production, Frye rewrote Akron's record books at the quarterback position, throwing for 11,049 yards and 64 TD's compared to just 32 INT's as a four-year starter.  Frye is a ""gamer"" that doesn't necessarily wow you with his natural skills but finds ways to get the job done.  He has good size above average athletic ability and adequate arm strength. In terms of physical tools and development, Frye is a notch below the three former MAC quarterbacks that have succeeded him in the NFL -- Chad Pennington (Jets), Byron Leftwich (Jaguars) and Ben Roethlisberger (Steelers) – but he is still a talented overall quarterback with the potential to develop into a starter at the next level. There are several quarterbacks competing to be the third taken after juniors' Aaron Rodgers (Cal) and Alex Smith (Utah).  Frye is among the leading candidates and, at the very least, should be one of the top-five quarterbacks to come off the board, likely between the second round and early-third.  ",NA,NA,NA

He began the 2002 season as a backup but quickly took over the starting job and exploded onto the national scene with 3,877 passing yards and 28 touchdowns compared to 15 interceptions in coach Dirk Koetter's wide-open offensive attack.   However, while Walter didn't play terribly as a junior in 2003, he did not make the progress that was expected.  His supporting cast was not what it was in '02 when he had go-to WR Shaun McDonald and he also suffered an ankle injury against UCLA that forced him to miss one game and hindered him for the final three games.  Walter was enjoying a bounce-back season as a senior in 2004 before suffering a season-ending shoulder injury versus Arizona.  The injury required surgery and prevented him from participating in the Senior Bowl and from working out at the combine. Walter reminds us a lot of a young, leaner, quicker Drew Bledsoe.  Walter is a tall pocket passer with great arm strength and a calm demeanor.  While he isn't a good athlete, he is a little bit quicker than Bledsoe and he can move around within the pocket and avoid the rush a lot better than Bledsoe can.  Like Bledsoe, however, Walter can fit the ball into a lot of tight spots that other quarterbacks can't but he also tries to fit the ball into some spots that even he can't slip it into, which leads to obvious problems.  Walter was having a strong senior season until suffering the shoulder injury.  While durability is a bit of an overall concern in regards to Walter's longevity in the NFL, the injury itself shouldn't cause him to drop much.  Walter will need time to develop and he by no means is a complete product at this time. However, his upside is great enough for a team to understandably take a chance on him in the second round.

Greene became the ""winningest"" Division 1-A quarterback in NCAA history with 42 career victories breaking the old mark of 39 by Tennessee's Peyton Manning. During that time he also led the Bulldogs to a 15-2 record when playing on the opponents' home field. Most impressive about Greene are his leadership and proven ability to manage a game.  Greene doesn't have elite overall physical tools but he's accurate, he knows how to win and he is a high-character player that does things the right way.  In many ways, he reminds us of Patriots' QB Tom Brady.  Greene won't be drafted as late as Brady was (6th round), but his lack of ideal size, strength and mobility will likely cause him to slip to the third or fourth round of the upcoming draft.

Orton had more of a rollercoaster season as a senior in 2004, as he was one of the ""hottest"" quarterbacks in the nation for the first half of the season but cooled off in the second half, partially due to a lingering hip injury.  Orton finished the season completing 60.7-percent of his attempts for 3,090 yards with 31 TD's and five INT's.  Orton spent a good majority of his time at Purdue working out of the shotgun and he struggled with the adjustment of taking snaps from under center during the Senior Bowl.  As was the case with former Purdue star Drew Brees (Chargers), it may take Orton longer to make the transition to the NFL than other quarterbacks that had better experience in a more traditional offense.  Orton needs to improve the quickness of his delivery and become much more consistent when put under pressure.  Otherwise, Orton has the physical tools and makeup to develop into a solid starter in the NFL.  He has the size, arm strength, accuracy and mind that it takes to succeed at the next level.  There's no question that Orton is a risky ""boom or bust"" type of prospect, but he has enough physical tools and was successful enough at the highest level of college football to warrant second round consideration in the 2005 NFL draft.

His arm is also stronger than he gets credit for.  In terms of work ethic, character, toughness and overall intangibles, Lefors has everything you look for in a quarterback.  Lefors is still nothing more than a mid-round prospect that will need to be drafted by a team that employs a West Coast scheme (such as the Eagles and Seahawks) or for a team like the Broncos that works to get its quarterbacks outside of the pocket on a lot of play-action and bootlegs.

McPherson took over as a starter at Florida State in just his sophomore season in 2002 but was kicked off the team following a well-publicized gambling scandal.  He tried to enroll at Tennessee State but the NCAA made it nearly impossible, which led to his decision to turn pro and play in the Arena Football League.  McPherson quickly developed into one of the most effective and dynamic quarterbacks in the AFL, playing for the Indiana Firebirds.  Now, at the age of 20, McPherson has elected to make himself available for the 2005 NFL draft.  McPherson spent his pre-draft process training with Florida with former teammates Craphonso Thorpe, P.K. Sam and Bryant McFadden.  What makes McPherson so intriguing as a mid-to-late round draft prospect in 2005 is that he has the physical tools of a Day 1 pick.  Few quarterbacks in this class are as talented.  McPherson obviously has a lot of baggage.  He also still needs to improve his mechanics, lower body strength and consistency on the deep ball.  However, after spending time breaking down film of McPherson in the AFL and also after talking to people that have been around the much more mature McPherson recently, we feel strongly that he's worth the risk early on Day 2.  McPherson has learned tough lessons, he never brought down any others that were involved in his off-the-field issues with him and he has grown up a great deal in the past couple of years.

However, Clemens still has a lot of room to improve in terms of his consistency, patience and accuracy as a pocket passer.  He will need lots of polishing at the NFL level and there is no guarantee that he will ever improve enough in those areas to compete for a starting job.

However, with behind a patchwork offensive line and with a complete facelift at the wide receiver position, Whitehurst struggled early as a junior.

After a strong start in 2003, Croyle was lost for the season late in the third quarter of the Western Carolina game when he tore the ACL in his right knee. He had surgery on Sept. 20. By that point in the season, he had completed 67-percent of his passes (44 of 66) for 534 yards and six touchdowns. He had not thrown an interception in those 66 attempts.  As a senior in 2005, Croyle completed 59.6-percent of his attempts for 2,499 yards with 14 TD's and four INT's.   Croyle has some upside because of his outstanding arm strength and leadership skills.  However, he's not a great athlete, he has below-average size, and he has a terrible history of durability issues.   While he did stay healthy and play well during his senior season in 2005, Croyle does not enter the NFL with great playing experience at the collegiate level and we also have huge doubts regarding his potential to stay healthy for an entire 16-game season if anointed as a starter in the NFL.

Jacobs flashed first round potential as a first-year starter in 2004 but he failed to build on that momentum during an injury-riddled and inconsistent junior campaign in 2005. Instead of returning for his senior season, Jacobs elected to take his chances in the 2006 draft -- a sizeable mistake in our opinion.  Jacobs has all the physical tools necessary to develop into a starting quarterback in the NFL.  He has great size, as well as good arm strength and mobility.   He can be an accurate short-to-intermediate passer and he has shown flashes of good decision-making skills.  However, Jacobs will need a lot of work in order to polish his game for the next level.  His release point is too low and his consistency as a deep-ball passer needs to improve.  He also comes from a pass-friendly, shotgun-oriented offensive scheme, which means he  likely will require more developmental time than other quarterback prospects with similar skill sets.

However, he makes a lot of mistakes and has gotten into some bad habits due to the marginal supporting cast.  He also has some durability concerns, which will cause him to slip a bit.

As a senior, he attracted attention as a Heisman Trophy candidate and finished the season ranked ninth in the nation in total offense (4,509 yards). Ryan missed one game in 2006 (Buffalo) after breaking a bone in his left foot.As expected, Ryan thrived in a more wide open system as a senior.  He also proved to be more mobile and accurate than in 2006, when he was clearly bothered by a broken bone in his left foot.  While he will never be a running threat, Ryan displays the feet and pocket presence to buy second-chance passing opportunities. He will still occasionally miss an open receiver and he also is forcing more throws as a senior, but part of that can be attributed to him being asked to shoulder the offense due to a sputtering running attack.  Regardless, Ryan has the best combination of intelligence, leadership, size, accuracy, arm strength and competitiveness in this year's quarterback class.  Hence, Ryan earns our highest grade at the position and one of the highest grades in the entire 2008 class.","Matt Ryan doesn't have the arm strength of a JaMarcus Russell, and he isn't a dynamic open-field runner, but he is clearly the most NFL-ready quarterback in this year's draft class. He has better-than-average arm strength, he's accurate and he understands the game. A lot has been made of the amount of interceptions he threw during his senior season at Boston College, but it's important to remember that he didn't have a strong receiving corps and that BC put the ball in the air far more often in 2007 than in years past.

He started all 11 games in 2006, completing 264 passes on 417 attempts (63.3 percent) for 18 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. As a senior, he played and started in 15 games, passing for 331 completions on 521 attempts for 4,263 yards, 23 touchdowns and only five interceptions for a 144.91 passer rating. Flacco also scored four rushing TDs. Although he started his collegiate career at Pittsburgh, the bulk of Flacco's production came at Delaware against a lower level of competition. So there are questions about his ability to adjust to the speed and complexities of NFL defenses. He also lacks experience working under center, so he has much to learn when it comes to his footwork and reading a defense while dropping.  However, there's no question he has the natural ability to make the leap.   Flacco shares a lot of the same qualities with Ben Roethlisberger.  He is deceptively mobile, throws well on the run and has arguably the strongest arm of any signal caller in the 2008 class.  Also, of the six quarterbacks at this year's Senior Bowl, Flacco showed the most improvement from the beginning to the end of the week.  It was important for the small school product to prove he can hang with the “big boys” and Flacco did just that.  Don't be surprised if he comes off the 2008 draft board in the second-to-third round range.","Baltimore fills its greatest need here. Flacco certainly has the makings of a franchise quarterback.

From where we stand, the experience has allowed Brohm to showcase aspects of his game never seen before.  First off, he has shown mental toughness in dealing with the adversity.  Secondly, he has eased concerns regarding durability by remaining healthy despite taking a beating throughout his senior season. On the plus side; he is a smart, hard working pocket passer with very good accuracy and the toughness to hang in the pocket.  On the minus side; he lacks ideal mobility, arm strength and leadership skills. Also, Brohm comes with some durability baggage.  With all that in mind, Brohm projects as a first-round selection but we still think he has too many weaknesses to stamp him with a top-15 grade.","Brian Brohm, like a lot of other young quarterbacks, can have a hard time beating pressure.

Despite missing three games as a senior (leg and shoulder injuries), Henne passed for 1,938 yards and 17 touchdowns in just 10 games. In addition to good size and arm strength, Henne brings to the table rare experience as a four-year starting quarterback at Michigan.   He's not the type of quarterback that can carry a team but he does an excellent job of managing games and distributing the ball to his playmakers.  He was considered the most durable quarterback in the senior class prior to the 2007 season.  However, knee and shoulder injuries have caused him to miss significant time.  Henne is the type of quarterback that will shine in pre-draft workouts because he is such a gifted natural passer when he can set his feet and throw unhurried.  However, his lack of mobility and erratic decision-making skills when under pressure are legitimate concerns in our opinion.  Henne should come off the board in the second round of the upcoming draft.  His intangibles, toughness and work ethic will allow him to overcome some physical limitations but his NFL career could be defined by how much he can improve his feet over the next few years.","Henne has good size and very good arm strenghth, so he can find the open receiver and get him the ball. Much like Brohm, he's a student of the game; his ability to break down defense should improve with time.

In our opinion, while Booty might lack the physical skills to emerge as good starter in the NFL, he is the type of hard working, cerebral quarterback that could overcome the odds.

He also rushed 153 times for 625 yards (4.1 average) and three touchdowns in that span. Dixon was knocked out of a game in 2005 with a concussion. He exploded as a senior, completing 67.7 percent of his pass attempts for 2,136 yards, 20 touchdowns and just four interceptions in 10 games to rank third in the nation in passer efficiency (161.2). He also ran for 583 yards (5.0 average) and nine touchdowns before suffering a torn ACL in his left knee at Arizona in November. Few players improved their draft stock as much as Dixon did during the first couple months of the 2007 season.  Unfortunately for Dixon, a knee injury cut his remarkable senior campaign short.  When healthy, Dixon has enough redeeming qualities as a developmental project to consider drafting in the middle rounds.  He has always been blessed with a great frame, a strong arm and excellent athletic ability.   However, in order to compete for a starting job in the NFL, he must improve his bulk, strength and overall efficiency as a passer.  And that's assuming  he makes a full recovery. While his upside is intriguing, Dixon has entirely too many strikes against him to warrant consideration in the first three rounds.  A team willing to take that type of risk must consider these four hurdles: 1) He must recover from ACL tear.  2) He only starred for two months of one season (less than another one-hit wonder from Oregon, Akili Smith).  3) He comes from a spread offense that has not translated well to the NFL.  4) There is very little assurance he will choose to play football professionally instead of returning to the baseball field.","Dixon's stock dropped after he suffered a knee injury late last season. But he made great strides as a passer last season and has great speed to develop into a reserve receiver. He could be the heir to Charlie Batch, and in the meantime, could see some time as a receiver. His ability to throw the ball allows the Steelers to work in some gadget plays.

Most importantly, he proved that he's not just a running quarterback by remaining patient in the pocket and going through his progressions before opting to run as a final option.  Johnson is still very much underrated in our opinion and he's worth the investment in Round 3.","The learning curve is higher for Johnson after playing at a small school.

He enrolled at Saddleback Community College (Calif.) in 2004, completing 68.3 percent of his passes for 281.3 yards per game, 23 touchdowns and just four interceptions in nine games. He transferred to Hawaii in 2005 and went on to set an NCAA Division I-A record in career total offense per game (387.89). In three seasons at Hawaii (2005-'07), Brennan made 35 starts (in 38 games) and completed 1,115 of 1,584 pass attempts (70.4 percent) for 14,193 yards, 131 touchdowns and 42 interceptions. He also had 267 carries for 547 yards (2.1 average) and 15 touchdowns. Injuries hampered him as a senior, but he still ranked second in the nation in passing yards per game (361.9) and fifth in passer efficiency (159.8). In 12 games (11 starts), Brennan completed 359 of 510 attempts for 4,343 yards, 38 TDs and 17 interceptions. Despite an ankle injury, he also ran for eight TDs. Brennan is not as athletic or nearly as polished as Jeff Garcia.  But like Garcia, he is very slightly built and has to really load up to throw the deep ball. Also like Garcia, Brennan is light on his feet and is very accurate. There's a lot to like about his confident, gun-slinging mentality.  However, there also are a lot of red flags to consider when evaluating his risk-reward level, including marginal size, below-average arm strength, off-the-field history and spread system that has not translated well to the NFL in past years.  Brennan isn't for every system at the next level and his ability to cut heavy winds or bad weather should be a concern, especially for teams like Baltimore and Chicago.  A warm weather team operating a West Coast offensive system could consider Brennan in the middle rounds, but we wouldn't risk anything higher than a fourth round pick.","Brennan put up outstanding numbers at Hawaii. He's quick enough to buy time in the pocket and accurate enough to lead receivers when throwing underneath. However, there are substantial concerns about the Hawaii spread scheme inflating his numbers and he doesn't have great arm strength, either. His recent hip surgery raises concerns about Brennan's ability to stay healthy too. ",NA,NA

Woodson also rushed for five touchdowns. As a senior, his 40 touchdown passes set school and SEC records. He finished the year with 327 completions on 518 attempts (63.1 percent), 3,709 passing yards and just 11 interceptions. Woodson has prototypical size, excellent arm strength and good accuracy as a passer.  He also is a proven playmaker in the clutch.  However, Woodson has a hitch in his delivery and it takes him too long to get rid of the ball.  With the speed in the NFL and the defensive backs' ability to break on and attack the ball, Woodson needs to get this fixed or he risks getting a lot of his out routes taken back the other way for defensive scores.  Furthermore, while he has made significant strides mentally, Woodson still needs to break some bad habits, such as locking on to primary target too frequently.  Woodson still has enough upside to emerge as a solid NFL starter but he must find a way to speed up his delivery without affecting his accuracy as a passer  much easier said than done.  Woodson's stock has taken a sizeable hit from early in his senior season, when he was soaring up draft boards following big performances versus Louisville, Arkansas and LSU.  Woodson is a bit of an enigma right now but he should come off the board in the second-to-third round range.","The hitch in Woodson's release played a big role in his poor showing at the Senior Bowl and caused his stock to plummet.

This is certainly a pick that seems to make a lot of sense because the Dolphins know everything about this guy with Miami offensive coordinator Mike Sherman as his former head coach at Texas A&M. Tannehill has a tremendous skill set, but there's a lot of room to develop. Under new head coach Joel Philbin, the Dolphins' offense is a version of a West Coast offense with a large variety of formations and personnel packages, much like he ran at Green Bay as offensive coordinator. This is a sophisticated offense that puts a premium on decision-making and reads, and Tannehill just needs time to recognize matchups, see blitzes and learn how to audible at the line of scrimmage. These are all things he can do, that he will likely sit for a good portion of his rookie season and will learn behind Matt Moore or David Garrard. This is not a QB to start from day one.

<p><b>How he fits:</b>
He certainly looks like the QB of the future and that future needs to be now for a 28-year-old. He can make every throw necessary to eventually fit in this West Coast offense and he can make all the required reads. He's coming from a college system in which he ran a lot of spread formations with quick passes and easy reads. And in this West Coast look, his passes will have to become more disciplined and his reads more focused. His ability to handle the blitz must improve dramatically, but having Trent Richardson in the fold could make his job easier. As fast as you want him to get into the lineup, it is likely he will learn in the first half of the season to improve that decision-making behind Colt McCoy. If he makes the right progress, he could be their starter in the last two months of the season.

Osweiler has exceptional size at nearly 6-foot-7, and has above-average athleticism considering his length. While he's a bit raw and needs to work on his mechanics, he flashes tremendous upside with a quick release, a strong arm and natural accuracy. 

</p>
<p><b>How he fits:</b>
The Broncos have hopefully learned that as great as Peyton Manning is, he needs a quality backup. He didn't have it in Indy, but Osweiler is that guy in Denver. He's a big with a tremendous skill set and he's playing behind Manning. He can take his time to play under center and run an NFL offense as opposed to the spread packages in college. Right now, Caleb Hanie is the backup and Osweiler will be No. 3 for this year, but look for him to be developed the way Aaron Rodgers was behind Brett Favre. This is a great spot for him.

Of course there are concerns about his height and how it's going to affect his ability to scan the field, but if he's 4 inches taller, he's probably a top-10 pick. He's a great leader, he makes sound decisions, he's accurate and he has more than enough arm strength to make it in the NFL.

</p>
<p><b>How he fits:</b> 
His lack of size has been well-documented, but other than that he has every quality you are looking for in a QB. Initially, this doesn't look like a need for the Seahawks with their acquisition of Matt Flynn, but backup Tavaris Jackson has only one year left on his contract and they like young, developmental guy Josh Portis a little bit. And we really don't know if Matt Flynn can be the guy. At the very least, Wilson can move up to a solid No. 2 guy. He will be a pleasure to coach.

You would not think this is a position of need, but Michael Vick is over 30 and his contract is up after this season. Backup Mike Kafka knows the system but is not special nor is UFA pickup Trent Edwards. Andy Reid loves to develop young QBs. He has at least a year to see if Foles can be that guy.

Cousins makes up for his average pocket mobility and arm strength with accuracy, sound decisions and leadership. He may never develop into a starter, but he could and should quickly develop into an excellent backup.

At first glance, this looks like a luxury pick because his chances of competing with RG3 are minimal. But Cousins has the instincts and the skills to run Mike Shanahan's offense. He has a chance to run it more effectively early as RG3 learns the offense. He can be an excellent backup and he should be a great quarterback meeting teammate as these two young guys learn the system together.

Manuel's upside could be very intriguing, although this coaching staff has been very secretive about its offensive philosophy. We will likely see creative personnel groupings, an up-tempo passing game with some read-option wrinkles and perhaps even see an old version of the K-Gun offense that the Bills ran years ago with Jim Kelly. This is a coaching staff which can afford the time to bring along Manuel, and it already has a potentially good run game to take some pressure off him. This selection seems to tell us this is going to be a very creative offensive package. It will be fun to watch, with a variety of exotic looks.",NA,NA

And while he is a pocket passer first and foremost, he has the athleticism to turn a negative into a positive when the play breaks down. He won't turn around the franchise immediately, but if handled the right way Smith could turn into a solid starter. <br>
<b>How he fits:</b> It's really not a surprise that this position has been a mess, and it looks as if the Jets have decided to break up this group and start over. Mark Sanchez will probably have one more year -- maybe as the starter -- but with a coaching staff that has a short leash. Smith might be pushed to play earlier than expected.

Freeman continues to have inconsistent streaks and make bad decisions, and Glennon has a good enough skill set to potentially develop into a good player.

He has very good arm strength and shows an above-average command of the offense. He locates the open man and gets though his progressions. He also made huge improvements in his decision-making late in his college career. But he's streaky with his accuracy and struggles with touch throws and under pressure. Stanley does fit the ball into some tight spots that many QBs cannot, and his deep-ball accuracy is outstanding. He takes too long to get to the top of his drop, and he doesn't have the foot quickness to sidestep interior pressure. He appears faster than quick and can scramble for the occasional first down. Stanley grades out as a pocket passer with good size and arm strength but needs to be more accurate and take better care of the football. <em>-- March 2020</em>",NA,Stanley has prototypical size and good arm strength.
